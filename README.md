## Ramotion Animated Tab Bar {N} Plugin

A plugin to bring the exceptional work of [Ramotion](https://ramotion.com/) into the {N} platform.

Animated Tab Bar is an expanding content cell inspired by folding paper material. 

As [Ramotion](https://ramotion.com/) is as **forward thinking** as they are **super cool & talented**, they open sourced it which allows us to make it available to the {N} community.

Animated Tab Bar Source for the [iOS Platform](https://github.com/Ramotion/animated-tab-bar)

## Issues

>Flooding the native implementations repo with {N} specific implementation problems is discourteous. 
>They were kind enough open source some really great UI / UX please respect the fact it is not their responsibility to investigate or solve issues using this plugin in NativeScript.

Please create issues [here](https://github.com/DeviantJS/nativescript-animated-tab-bar/issues) first and only after it has been properly vetted to not be an {N} specific implementation problem
should you open an issue in the [FoldingCell GitHub repo](https://github.com/Ramotion/animated-tab-bar/issues).
